## About the project

I work as an occupational therapist with elderly people. I have recently graduated from a 2-year yh education as a Python developer. I studied this because I want to help developing tech for healthcare workers and their patients.

The KFALL dataset is alluring because its purpose is to help prevent falls among the elderly.

I have taken task nr 30, "forward fall while walking caused by a trip" but you can change to another task with a small adjustment.

I used KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn and its standard implementation gave me great results for this dataset. With a gridsearch it became even better.

I will keep on experimenting with this.

## Implementation

Sometimes elderly people are not able to tell what happened, with this tech it would perhaps be possible to save information on what kind of fall it was? This would be invaluable information when trying to prevent falls.
